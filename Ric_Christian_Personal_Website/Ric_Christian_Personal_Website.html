<!--Summary-->
<div class="personal_info">
    <p id="p1"> <!--here is ang descriptoin nyo-->
        As Ric, a man lost in his ocean of thoughts, he tries to reflect on every decision he made in life and also tries to think ahead in order to choose the right path for his life but to an extreme extent, in short, an overthinker! But that's not totally a bad thing, as he overly relfects on everything, he has the mental capacity to understand what's right and wrong, also he can assess if it's actually right or wrong. In order for him to not drown in the vast ocean of thoughts, he copes with two important physical activity in his life, dancing and weight training. As a dancer for almost a decade, dancing wasn't really a talent he had before but as time goes by and as he practice dancing day in and day out, he has reached a level where he thinks he is quite decent and is eager to explore the culture and learn more knowledge about it. Enjoying the art of dancing, the line he always says to people who ask about him dancing is "It wasn't a talent I had but through hard work I earned this skill and willing to hone it more." on the other hand, weight training, it is a physical activity he had recently tried and is genuinely enjoying the proccess of him building the physique he wants, this has been a hobby he does for a little more over than a year, he still thinks this will continue throught out the following years as he says "In the beginning, I wanted the results but as time passes by I cared less about the results and kept enjoying the proccess." as he states this, it shows that it's not always about the destination but it's about the journey you had gone through. Despite this man lost in the ocean of thoughts, he never let himself drown in his own thoughts and kept swimming to maybe reach a place where he can finally be genuinely happy and to not be stuck in a endless loop of thoughts!
